# User Stories📚:

## User Story #1 📖 "compare"

Allows a user to compare total  COVID-19 cases and deaths for up to five countries during a specified week 

#### Usage:
To run this scenario, the user would input:
python3 cl.py --compare "Brazil" "France" -- week "2021-02-14"

The output would look something like:
Brazil: 318290 cases, 7455 deaths
France: 110436 cases, 2892 deaths 

## User Story #2 📖 "stats"

Allows a user to display the total weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths for a chosen country (Maximum of five)

#### Usage: 
To run this scenario, the user would input:
python3 cl.py --country "France" --weeks "2021-02-14" "2021-03-14"

The output would look something like:
Week of 2021-02-15: 110436 cases, 2892 deaths 
Week of 2021-03-15: 142978 cases, 1872 deaths

# Acceptance Tests ✅
For this project, our Acceptance Tests can be found under the "Tests" folder in files titled "test_cl.py" and "test_app.py".

### Purpose of Acceptance Tests
Acceptance tests are designed to ensure that the tool meets the requirements outlined in the user stories. These tests simulate real-world usage scenarios to verify that the tool behaves as expected.

### How They Relate to User Stories
1. **User Story #1: compare**
   - The `test_cl.py` file contains tests for the `--compare` feature.
   - These tests verify that the tool correctly compares COVID-19 statistics for up to five countries during a specified week.
   - Example: The test ensures that running the command `python3 cl.py --compare "France" "Brazil" --week "2021-02-15"` produces the expected output format and data.

2. **User Story #2: stats**
   - The `test_cl.py` file also includes tests for the `--stats` feature.
   - These tests validate that the tool displays weekly COVID-19 cases and deaths for a chosen country over multiple weeks.
   - Example: The test ensures that running the command `python3 cl.py --country "France" --weeks "2021-03-01" "2021-03-08" "2021-03-15"` produces the correct weekly statistics.

### How to Run the Tests
To run the acceptance tests, use the following command in the terminal:

python3 -m unittest Tests/test_cl.py

This will execute the tests and confirm whether the tool behaves as expected for the scenarios described in the user stories.
